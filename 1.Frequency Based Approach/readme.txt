This is a baseline model for comparaison against regression based solution for extension of Cellular Automaton to Gray-scale images in the 
case of denoising Salt and Pepper noise.

This weights for recombination as found by this method are later used for initialization of regression weights beacuse it is very 
computationally cheap to compute and provides good warm start for the algorithm.
